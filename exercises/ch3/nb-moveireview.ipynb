For example, the first feature corresponds to the word \"the\" and the second feature corresponds to the word \"and.\"  The value of the feature is an integer from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating this word does not appear in the review (\"none\"), 1 indicating the word appears once (\"once\"), 2 indicating the word appears fewer than 5 times (\"some\"), 3 indicating the word appears fewer than 10 times (\"few\"), 4 indicating the word appears fewer than 20 times (\"many\"), and 5 indicating the word appears 20 times or more (\"lots\").\n",

A standard way to handle this is to add 1 to all counts (this is often called Laplace smoothing).  For frequent feature values, it does not change things much.  Do this separately for each table before normalizing.  For infrequent values, it keeps them away from 0 and admits that they might happen more often than was seen in the data.  This is like pretending there are extra examples that cause the raw counts to increase by 1.  \n",
