    "In the cell below, write code that generates a <b>pair plot</b>.  While there are libaries that do this automatically, to gain experience with using datasets and plotting, generate the pair plot using only numpy and matplotlib as libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pair plot is a grid of plots.  Each row corresponds to a different feature.  Each column also corresponds to a different feature.  *In this case, we will also include the $y$ values as a row and column.*  For this plot, order the target (y value) as the last \"feature.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the plot in grid position 1-2 is a plot involving feature 1 and feature 2.  Grid position 2-5 involves feature 2 and feature 5.  Grid position 0-6 involves the feature 0 and the target (y value).  Each individual plot is a scatter plot of the data with the row's feature along the vertical axis and the column's feature along the horizontal axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this version of a pair plot, we can omit (not plot) the plots on the diagonal grid cells (because they would be the same vertical and horizontal features).  Further, because the i-j plot and the j-i plot contain the same information, we need only plot one.  Plot only the \"lower triangular\" elements of the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to label the axes with the names of the corresponding feature (or y value).\n",

    "Hints:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> <a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/\">This page</a> documents the different <tt>matplotlib</tt> routines.</li>\n",
    "    <li> <tt>plt.subplots(...)</tt> will produce a set of axes in a grid.</li>\n",
    "    <li> You might want to try the <tt>sharex</tt> and <tt>sharey</tt> parameters of <tt>subplots</tt> to make the grid more compact.</li>\n",
    "    <li> You can remove a plot (for the \"upper part\" of the grid) by calling <tt>.remove()</tt> on the corresponding axes class.</li>\n",
    "    <li> You only need to label the horizontal axes once per column and the vertical axes once per row.</li>\n",
    "    <li> Plotting the point with an alpha value (of, say, 0.2) will help make the distribution more clear where the points overlap.</li>\n",
    "    <li> While the full pair plot would be a grid 7-by-7 (because there are 6 features plus 1 y value), because we will omit the diagonals and upper triangle, you can fit the resulting plots into a 6-by-6 grid.</li>\n",
